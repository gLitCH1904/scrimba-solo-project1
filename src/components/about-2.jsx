      <p>
        I am Industrial Engineering undergraduate and a frontend developer with
        a particular interest in making things simple and automating daily
        tasks. I try to keep up with security and best practices, and I'm always
        looking for new things to learn. I love collaborating with other
        developers and designers to work on creative projects
      </p>
